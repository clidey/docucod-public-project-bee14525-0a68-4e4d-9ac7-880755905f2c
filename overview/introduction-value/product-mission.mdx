# What is Linkwarden?

## Unlocking the Future of Bookmark Management

Linkwarden is a self-hosted, open-source bookmark manager designed to revolutionize how you save, preserve, and share the knowledge you find on the web. It goes beyond simple URL storage by capturing the full content of each link, enabling annotation, collaboration, and effortless sharing — all while ensuring your vital knowledge remains accessible and intact regardless of what happens online.

---

### Why Linkwarden Matters to You

- **Complete Content Preservation:** Unlike traditional bookmarking tools that save only URLs, Linkwarden archives entire web pages—including readable content, screenshots, PDFs, and monolithic snapshots. This means your bookmarks remain useful and accurate even if the original webpage changes or disappears.
- **Collaborative Collections:** Organize links into shared collections, invite collaborators, and collectively build a rich, curated knowledge base together.
- **Annotations and Highlights:** Add notes and highlights directly onto saved content to capture context, opinions, or insights for yourself and your team.
- **Open-Source & Self-Hosted:** Maintain full control over your data and customize the platform to your needs without vendor lock-in or cloud dependency.
- **Robust Search & Organization:** Use powerful search filters and tagging to find exactly what you need, when you need it.

### Who Benefits Most from Linkwarden?

- **Researchers and Academics:** Securely archive papers, articles, and studies with full content and annotations for deep analysis.
- **Teams and Organizations:** Build shared collections that enhance knowledge sharing without losing context from web changes.
- **Enthusiastic Curators:** Hobbyists and professionals who want a richer way to capture and revisit content beyond just links.
- **Privacy-Conscious Users:** Those who prefer hosting their bookmark data locally or on private infrastructure.

## What Is Linkwarden?

At its core, Linkwarden is a collaborative bookmark manager that is self-hosted and open-source. It solves the fundamental problem of link rot and loss of context by capturing multiple layers of bookmarked content and making it effortlessly accessible.

### The Challenge

Traditional bookmark managers often store only URLs, which are prone to becoming outdated, removed, or modified. This makes it difficult to rely on bookmarks for long-term knowledge preservation or collaboration.

### Linkwarden's Solution

Linkwarden preserves the entire content of the page, not just the link:

- **Full Archives:** Screenshots, PDFs, readable text versions, and monolith captures ensure multiple fallbacks to access the original material.
- **Annotations:** Users can highlight text and add comments to captured content enhancing comprehension and collaboration.
- **Sharing & Collaboration:** Multiple users can create, contribute to, and manage collections with granular permissions.
- **Flexible Organization:** Bookmark collections can be nested, tagged, and pinned to suit your workflow.

This comprehensive approach empowers users to maintain invaluable knowledge reliably over time and across teams.
