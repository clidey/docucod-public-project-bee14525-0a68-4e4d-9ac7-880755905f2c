# Deployment Overview

Welcome to the deployment overview for **Linkwarden** — a versatile bookmarking and archiving platform designed to seamlessly fit your operational requirements. This guide introduces you to the three primary deployment models available: the official Linkwarden Cloud service, self-hosted Docker-based installation, and advanced deployment options. Understanding the benefits and trade-offs of each will empower your team to select the ideal approach aligned with your infrastructure, security needs, and scalability goals.

---

## 1. Official Linkwarden Cloud Offering

### What It Is
The official Linkwarden Cloud is a fully managed service hosted by the Linkwarden team. It offers a hassle-free way to get started without dealing with infrastructure or configuration complexities.

### Key Benefits
- **Zero infrastructure management:** No need to provision servers, manage databases, or upkeep storage.
- **Automatic updates:** Receive the latest features and security patches without manual intervention.
- **Built-in scalability:** The cloud environment adapts automatically to usage demands.
- **Backups and reliability:** Data protection and uptime are handled with professional-grade standards.

### Ideal For
- Small to medium teams or individuals who want a turn-key solution.
- Organizations without dedicated DevOps resources.
- Users who prioritize ease of use, frequent updates, and responsive support.

### Considerations
- Limited control over server and infrastructure configuration.
- Hosting within Linkwarden’s cloud environment may have compliance or data residency constraints for some organizations.

<Tip>
Choosing the official cloud offering accelerates your time to value by eliminating setup tasks, enabling your team to focus directly on saving, organizing, and collaborating with bookmarks.

## 2. Self-Hosted Docker Deployment

### Overview
For teams seeking full control over their deployment environment, Linkwarden supports self-hosting through a Docker Compose-based setup. This method uses containerized services including PostgreSQL for database storage and Meilisearch for fast search capabilities.

### What You Get
- Complete control over your data hosting, security configurations, and network setup.
- Customization possibilities, such as tuning resources or integrating with your existing infrastructure.
- Ability to deploy in your private cloud, data centers, or local environments.

### Basic Deployment Flow
1. **Prepare your environment:** Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed.
2. **Configure environment variables (.env):** Set database credentials, ports, secrets, and other runtime options.
3. **Launch services:** Use the supplied `docker-compose.yml` which orchestrates the required containers: PostgreSQL, Linkwarden backend, and Meilisearch.
4. **Persist data:** Volumes in Docker preserve your database and search index across restarts.

### Example docker-compose snippet
```yaml
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:16-alpine
    env_file: .env
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - ./pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  meilisearch:
    image: getmeili/meilisearch:v1.12.8
    restart: always
    env_file:
      - .env
    volumes:
      - ./meili_data:/meili_data

  linkwarden:
    image: ghcr.io/linkwarden/linkwarden:latest
    env_file: .env
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@postgres:5432/postgres
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data/data
    depends_on:
      - postgres
      - meilisearch
    restart: always
```

### Operational Tips
- Make sure to secure your `.env` file and Docker volumes to protect sensitive data.
- Regularly backup your PostgreSQL data and Meilisearch index.
- Review service logs (`docker-compose logs`) for troubleshooting.

### When to Choose Self-Hosting
- When data privacy, sovereignty, or regulatory compliance require internal hosting.
- If you need customized integration with existing systems or networks.
- When you prefer managing the lifecycle of your services and want flexibility.

<Warning>
Self-hosting demands basic to advanced DevOps knowledge. Misconfiguration can lead to security risks or data loss. Proceed only if you have the capacity to maintain the deployment environment.
</Warning>

## 3. Advanced Deployment Options

Beyond the standard Cloud and Docker Compose approaches, Linkwarden offers flexibility for more sophisticated environments.

### Custom Builds & Source Deployment
- Clone the Linkwarden repository to build the backend or the mobile app directly.
- Ideal for contributing to development, implementing custom features, or advanced integrations.

### Kubernetes or Container Orchestration
- You can adapt the Docker Compose stack into Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts for scalable production environments.
- Enables fine-grained control of resources, scaling, and rolling updates.

### Cloud Provider-Specific Deployments
- Linkwarden can be deployed on popular cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure) using container services or managed databases.
- You can utilize cloud-native features such as load balancers, auto-scaling groups, and secret management.

### Integration with Existing Systems
- If you operate centralized identity or logging services, advanced deploys can integrate with SSO providers or external monitoring systems.

<Info>
Advanced options are best suited to organizations with cloud infrastructure experience seeking to embed Linkwarden deeply into their tooling ecosystem.
