# User Management and Integrations

Manage user authentication and access securely, configure single sign-on (SSO) and OAuth providers, handle API access keys, and safely integrate third-party services to maintain seamless and controlled collaboration in Linkwarden deployments.

---

## 1. User Authentication Setup

Establish a secure and user-friendly authentication system tailored to your environment. This includes configuring local login, single sign-on (SSO), OAuth, and API key access.

### 1.1 Local Authentication

- Users sign up and log in with username/email and password.
- Passwords must meet complexity and length requirements (minimum 8 characters).
- Email verification ensures valid accounts.

### 1.2 Single Sign-On (SSO) and OAuth Providers

- Integrate external identity providers (Google, GitHub, etc.) for streamlined user access.
- Configure provider credentials and secrets within your environment variables.
- When users change their email addresses, all linked SSO sessions with that email are revoked for security.

### 1.3 API Access Tokens

- Generate personal access tokens to allow programmatic or third-party application access without exposing passwords.
- Tokens have customizable expiration durations (from 7 days to no expiration).
- Users must securely store tokens at creation as they are shown only once.
- Revoke tokens immediately when no longer needed to preserve account security.

<Tip>
Create API tokens only when necessary and treat them like passwords to prevent unauthorized access.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Access Control Management

Control who can access, view, and collaborate on data within your Linkwarden instance.

### 2.1 User Roles and Permissions

- Assign roles such as Viewer (read-only), Contributor (read and create), and Admin (full access).
- Roles determine access scope within collections and system-wide.

### 2.2 Profile Privacy and Visibility

- Users can make profiles private to restrict who can discover them.
- Whitelist trusted users by specifying their usernames, allowing profile visibility only to selected individuals.

<Tip>
Use profile privacy settings to protect personal information and control team visibility.
</Tip>

### 2.3 Team Invitations and Seat Management

- Invite new users via email to join your team.
- Accepting an invitation increases seat usage and billing automatically.
- Manage purchased seats and monitor active users through the administration interface.

<Warning>
Removing a user revokes their access and requires a new registration plus subscription to regain it.
</Warning>

## 3. Third-Party Integrations

Safely manage and configure external integrations essential for billing, storage, and authentication.

### 3.1 Stripe Billing Integration

- Link your Stripe account via secret keys set in environment variables.
- Use the billing portal to manage subscriptions and payments.
- Updates to email addresses in Linkwarden propagate to Stripe billing records.

### 3.2 Cloud Storage Providers

- Configure external storage services for file and archive storage (Amazon S3, Azure Blob, Google Cloud Storage, etc.) via environment variables.
- Secure credentials with proper secret management.

### 3.3 OAuth Providers and SSO Configuration

- Ensure OAuth client IDs and secrets are securely stored.
- Regularly audit linked providers and revoke outdated or unused connections.

---

## 4. Security Best Practices

Maintain a hardened, secure user environment during deployment and operations.

- **Password Management:** Enforce strong passwords and regular changes.
- **Token Security:** Limit token scope and lifetime; instruct users to store tokens safely.
- **Access Control:** Use role-based permissions and profile privacy proactively.
- **Session Management:** Automatically revoke sessions when emails change or accounts are deleted.
- **Audit and Monitoring:** Track user activities and integration usage for anomalies.
- **Environment Secrecy:** Protect secrets and keys using environment variables and secure vaults.

<Tip>
Regularly review user lists, token usage, and integration settings to reduce security risks.
</Tip>

## 5. Managing Users via API

Linkwarden offers user management capabilities through its API for automation and administrative workflows.

- Retrieve user information securely with authentication.
- Update user data, including roles, profile details, and permissions.
- Delete users when necessary, respecting administrative privileges and demo restrictions.

<Note>
Demo mode restricts user modification and deletion to prevent unintended data loss.
</Note>

---

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 6.1 Authentication Failures

- Verify environment variables for authentication provider access.
- Confirm user's email verification status.
- Check subscription status when Stripe integration is enabled.
- Ensure correct roles and permissions assigned.

### 6.2 Token Problems

- Tokens are single-use views; re-creation is necessary if lost.
- Revoke unused or compromised tokens promptly.

### 6.3 Integration Errors

- Confirm third-party credentials and secrets.
- Check network connectivity and firewall configurations.
- Validate billing portal links and subscription statuses.
