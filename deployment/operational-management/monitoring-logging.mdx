# Monitoring and Logging

Implementing effective monitoring and logging is critical to maintaining a healthy, reliable Linkwarden deployment. This guide equips you with the knowledge to surface operational insights, trace issues swiftly, and integrate Linkwarden logs into your organization’s centralized monitoring systems.

---

## Understanding Linkwarden Logging

Linkwarden’s logging system provides visibility into backend services, API activity, and the mobile app’s behavior. Logs capture key events, errors, and diagnostic information that help you monitor application health and troubleshoot issues promptly.

### Where Logs Originate

- **Backend Services**: API requests, database interactions, authentication flows, error conditions
- **Worker Processes**: Background tasks such as link processing, archiving, and AI tagging
- **Mobile App**: Client-side events, errors, and syncing activities

### Log Formats and Severity

Logs include detail levels filtered by severity:

- **ERROR**: Critical failures impacting functionality
- **WARN**: Potential issues requiring attention
- **INFO**: Routine operational events
- **DEBUG**: Detailed traces useful during development or troubleshooting

---

## Enabling and Configuring Logging

To capture detailed logs, configure your deployment environment accordingly:

1. **Set Environment Variables**
   - Adjust `.env` settings (see `/apps/mobile/.env.sample`) to enable verbose logging, e.g., `EXPO_PUBLIC_SHOW_LOGS` for the mobile app.

2. **Backend Logging Configuration**
   - Your backend framework supports environment-driven logging levels.
   - For production, keep logging at `INFO` or `WARN` to balance insight with performance.

3. **Mobile App Debugging**
   - Enable developer options to view client logs.
   - Use `expo-dev-menu` features during development for quick log access.

## Integrating with Centralized Monitoring

Consolidating Linkwarden logs into your existing monitoring infrastructure simplifies ongoing operational management.

### Typical Integrations

- **Log Aggregation Services**: ELK Stack (ElasticSearch, Logstash, Kibana), Splunk, Datadog
- **Cloud Monitoring**: AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, Google Cloud Logging
- **Alerting Systems**: PagerDuty, OpsGenie integrated via monitoring alerts

### Best Practices

- Forward logs securely using TLS to ensure data integrity and confidentiality.
- Tag logs with environment labels (`production`, `staging`, etc.) for filtered views.
- Store logs with a retention policy that balances compliance with storage costs.

---

## Log Retention and Maintenance

Decide log retention policies based on compliance mandates and operational needs.

- **Short-term (30-90 days)**: Retain verbose logs for active troubleshooting.
- **Long-term (Months to Years)**: Archive summarized or error-only logs for compliance and auditing.

Implement automated cleanup or archival tasks to avoid storage bloat.

## Troubleshooting Workflows Using Logs

When incidents occur, logs are your first line of defense to quickly identify root causes.

### Common Scenarios

- **Deployment Failures**
  - Check backend service startup logs for missing environment variables or connectivity errors.

- **Authentication Issues**
  - Inspect authentication logs for denied or expired token messages.

- **API Errors**
  - Follow error traces in backend logs to resolve API endpoint issues.

- **Mobile Sync Failures**
  - Review the mobile client logs via `expo-dev-menu` to diagnose syncing problems.

### Step-by-Step Log Analysis

<Steps>
<Step title="Identify the Problem Scope">
Begin by correlating user-reported issues with timestamps and affected components (frontend/backend).
</Step>
<Step title="Gather Relevant Logs">
Collect logs from all impacted services using filters like time ranges, severity, or user IDs.
</Step>
<Step title="Analyze Logs for Errors and Anomalies">
Look for ERROR or WARN entries, unusual delays, or failures in the transaction flow.
</Step>
<Step title="Correlate Across Systems">
Compare backend, worker, and mobile logs to trace error propagation.
</Step>
<Step title="Apply Fix or Escalate">
Use insights from logs to implement fixes or escalate with precise diagnostic information.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Practical Tips for Effective Monitoring

- **Centralize Logs Early**: Start forwarding logs to a central system during initial deployment.
- **Use Structured Logging**: Enables easier parsing and searching—JSON format is recommended.
- **Set Meaningful Alerting Thresholds**: Avoid alert fatigue yet catch critical incidents promptly.
- **Monitor Performance Metrics**: Complement logs with metrics like CPU, memory, request latency.
- **Regularly Review Logs and Alerts**: Use a scheduled process to validate monitoring effectiveness.

## Summary

Implementing robust monitoring and logging is essential to gain operational insight, swiftly resolve issues, and maintain a resilient Linkwarden service.

Continue by configuring environment variables for logging, integrating with your centralized monitoring system, and establishing log retention aligned with your organizational policies.

Refer to the troubleshooting guide for common setup problems and the environment configuration documentation for detailed variable settings.

## Next Steps

1. Review and configure logging environment variables as outlined.
2. Integrate Linkwarden logs with your organization’s monitoring tools.
3. Define and implement log retention policies.
4. Use logs proactively to detect and address issues.
5. Consult troubleshooting resources if deployment or runtime issues arise.

<Tip>
Effective monitoring and logging transform reactive firefighting into proactive reliability management. Start simple, then evolve your observability for confident Linkwarden operations.
