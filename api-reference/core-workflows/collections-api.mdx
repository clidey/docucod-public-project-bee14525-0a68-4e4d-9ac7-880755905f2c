# Collections API

Organize and manage your bookmarks efficiently using the Collections API. This API enables you to create, retrieve, update, and delete collections and sub-collections that form hierarchical structures. These structured groupings support both personal workflows and collaborative environments, allowing you to maintain clarity and control over your organized links.

---

## Overview

The Collections API is designed to empower you with full control over your bookmark collections. Whether you're building a simple list or a multi-layered hierarchy with nested sub-collections, this API supports:

- Creating new collections and sub-collections
- Fetching collection details including members and link counts
- Updating collection attributes and permissions
- Deleting collections

The API respects ownership and permissions to ensure secure collaborative workflows.

---

## Base URL

All requests to the Collections API use the following base URL:

```
/api/v1/collections
```

---

## Authentication

Every endpoint requires authentication via a valid user session or API token. Unauthorized requests receive appropriate HTTP status codes.


---

## Best Practices & Tips

- **Hierarchy Management:** When creating sub-collections, always verify you have ownership or permission of the parent collection to avoid authorization errors.
- **Naming Conventions:** Use clear and consistent collection names to facilitate faster retrieval and better organization.
- **Permissions:** Keep membership permissions updated to align with team collaboration needs and security policies.
- **Avoid Orphaned Collections:** When updating parent collections, ensure the hierarchy remains acyclic and valid to prevent nesting issues.
- **Demo Environment Restrictions:** Creation, update, and deletion operations might be disabled in demo mode.

## Common Errors and Troubleshooting

| Status Code | Cause                                            | Description and Action                                               |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 400         | Invalid request payload or missing collectionId | Review request data for missing or wrong fields.
| 401         | Unauthorized access or invalid authentication    | Ensure valid authentication token and required permissions.
| 403         | Permission denied for acting on a collection     | Confirm ownership or membership rights to perform the action.
| 404         | Collection not found                              | Check that the collection ID is correct and accessible.

## Practical Workflow Example

Imagine you want to organize your saved links for a new project:

<Steps>
<Step title="Create a New Collection">
Use the POST endpoint to create a collection named `Project Alpha` to gather all relevant links.
</Step>
<Step title="Add Sub-Collections">
Create sub-collections such as `Research`, `References`, and `Useful Tools` by specifying the parentId to build a hierarchy.
</Step>
<Step title="Update Collection Details">
Adjust colors, icons, and permission members to collaborate with your team.
</Step>
<Step title="Fetch Collection Details">
Use the GET method to review the collection structure and current members.
</Step>
<Step title="Delete Unused Collections">
Remove outdated or obsolete collections to maintain cleanliness.
</Step>
</Steps>
