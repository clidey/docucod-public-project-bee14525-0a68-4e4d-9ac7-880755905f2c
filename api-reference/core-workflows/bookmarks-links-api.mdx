# Links (Bookmarks) API Reference

Manage your bookmarks programmatically with the Links (Bookmarks) API. This API enables you to create, retrieve, update, delete, and bulk manage links within your collections. It also supports advanced actions such as archiving preserved content, bulk edits, and powering search and annotation workflows.

---

## Overview

The Links API is your gateway to programmatically managing every aspect of your bookmarks in Linkwarden. Whether you're adding a new URL, fetching details about a saved link, editing metadata, or performing bulk operations, this API covers these needs with RESTful endpoints.

You can use the Links API to:

- Add bookmarks with rich metadata including tags and collections.
- Retrieve single or multiple links, filtered by tags, collections, pinned status, or search queries.
- Update link details and organize tags and collections.
- Delete individual or multiple links with safety checks.
- Trigger archiving actions to preserve link content in various formats.

The API supports all core bookmarking workflows needed to automate or integrate your Linkwarden system with custom apps, scripts, or UI layers.

## Base Endpoint

```

All requests are made relative to this base path.

## Authentication & Authorization

Every request requires authentication. This is typically handled via session tokens or API Bearer tokens passed in the `Authorization` header.

## Practical Usage Scenarios

### Adding Your First Bookmark

1. Prepare your link data with URL, optional name, description, tags, and collection.
2. Call `POST /api/v1/links` with your payload.
3. On success, receive the complete link object with assigned ID.

### Fetching Links by Tag and Search

1. Use `GET /api/v1/links` with query parameters like `tagId`, and `searchQueryString`.
2. Navigate through pages using the `cursor` parameter.
3. Use `sort` to adjust order (e.g., newest first).

### Bulk Editing Tags or Moving Collections

1. Gather the list of links you want to update.
2. Prepare the `PUT /api/v1/links` request, including `newData` and `links`.
3. Decide whether to `removePreviousTags` or merge with existing tags.

### Deleting Multiple Links

1. Collect the list of link IDs to delete.
2. Call `DELETE /api/v1/links` with the `linkIds` array in the body.
3. Server cleans up all preserved files and metadata.

## Best Practices & Tips

- **Prevent Duplication:** Enable 'preventDuplicateLinks' in user settings to avoid saving the same link multiple times.
- **Pagination:** Always check for `nextCursor` in responses to fetch subsequent pages.
- **Archival Use:** Use archive endpoints to maintain link preservation beyond metadata.
- **Bulk Operations:** Use bulk updates/deletions sparingly to reduce server load.
- **Demo Mode:** In publicly hosted demo environments, write operations may be disabled.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Errors

| Status Code | Cause                           | Resolution                           |
|-------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 400         | Invalid request payload        | Verify JSON schema and required fields. |
| 401         | Unauthorized                   | Confirm valid authentication token. |
| 404         | Link or resource not found     | Check the ID is correct and accessible. |
| 409         | Duplicate Link detected        | Avoid saving the same URL twice if duplication prevention is enabled. |
| 500         | Internal Server Error           | Retry later or contact support.    |

### Handling Invalid URLs

When submitting links, ensure URLs are valid and accessible. Invalid or unsupported URLs may result in failure or warnings.

### Archived Content Permissions

Modifying or deleting archived content requires appropriate permissions on the collection.
