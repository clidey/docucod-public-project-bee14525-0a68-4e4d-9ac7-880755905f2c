# Vulnerability Reporting & Responsible Disclosure

If you discover a security flaw or vulnerability within Linkwarden, this document guides you through the responsible reporting process. Our commitment is to address reported issues promptly, discreetly, and professionally to ensure the safety and trust of all users.

## 1. Why Responsible Disclosure Matters

Security vulnerabilities can expose user data or disrupt service availability. Responsible disclosure is a vital collaboration between security researchers, users, and the Linkwarden team to address these risks safely. By following our reporting process, you help protect the Linkwarden community while enabling us to fix the issue efficiently.


## 2. How to Report a Vulnerability

When you identify a potential security issue, your report should include clear, actionable information to help our team understand and reproduce the problem. Please send your report to our official security contact:
