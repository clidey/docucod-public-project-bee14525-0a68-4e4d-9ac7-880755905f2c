# User Privacy & Data Controls

Welcome to the User Privacy & Data Controls guide for Linkwarden. This page empowers you to understand exactly what personal data is stored, how long it is kept, and the powerful privacy settings available to you—whether you're an individual user or an admin. Take control of your information by exploring data export and deletion workflows, public sharing controls, and link or collection visibility settings.

## 1. What Personal Data Does Linkwarden Store?

Linkwarden is designed to respect your privacy and minimize data exposure. The personal data associated with your account typically includes:

- **Account Information:** Username, email address, hashed passwords, profile images (avatars).
- **User Preferences:** Theme selection, reading fonts, archival settings, and dashboard configurations.
- **Bookmarks and Collections:** Your saved links, associated metadata, tags, and archival captures.
- **Subscription & Usage Details:** For paid users, subscription status and seat allocation managed via Stripe.

All passwords are securely hashed, and sensitive operations like email changes or password resets require verification to protect your information.

### How Long Is Data Retained?

Your data remains retained on Linkwarden's servers as long as your account is active. Data retention policies ensure that:

- Data tied to active accounts is preserved indefinitely to support your ongoing use.
- Upon account deletion, all personal data and bookmarks are removed promptly from primary storage.

If you need more details or want to request deletion, please refer to the export/deletion workflows below.

## 2. User & Admin Privacy Settings

Linkwarden provides a suite of privacy controls allowing both users and admins to manage visibility, access, and sharing.

### User-Controlled Settings

These are adjustable directly from your user preferences:

- **Account Privacy:** Set your account to "private" to restrict who can view your bookmarks and collections.
- **Link Visibility:** Choose if individual links or entire collections are public, shared with select users, or fully private.
- **Public Sharing Controls:** Manage public URLs for collections or links and toggle public access on or off.
- **Whitelisted Users:** Specify users you trust who can view content even when your account or collections are private.
- **Archival & Preservation Preferences:** Select how your saved content is archived (screenshots, PDFs, readable versions) impacting what data is stored.
- **Duplicate Prevention:** Enable or disable prevention of duplicate links to tidy your data.

### Admin Controls

Admins can manage broader privacy through:

- **User Account Management:** View user compliance with privacy settings, update or remove accounts, including deleting personal data upon request.
- **Subscription Management:** Oversee active users under a subscription, ensuring seat limits respect privacy boundaries.
- **Policy Enforcement:** Enforce email verification, API token restrictions, and audit privacy settings on behalf of users.

<Tip>
Admins play a critical role in maintaining privacy standards by balancing user autonomy with organizational security and compliance needs.

- **Visibility Settings at Link Level:** Override collection settings on individual links for finer control.

### Visibility Controls Explained

| Setting           | Description                                        |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|

## 5. Managing Your Privacy Settings in the App

The Linkwarden interface makes adjusting privacy straightforward.

### Personalizing Privacy

1. Go to **Settings** → **Preferences**.
2. Change your **Account Privacy** toggle to private or public.

### Controlling Link and Collection Visibility

- Within your collections, use the **Sharing** settings to toggle between private, shared, and public access.
- For individual links, adjust visibility in the link’s detail view.

<Steps>
<Step title="Add Whitelisted Users">
Navigate to your privacy settings and locate the Whitelisted Users section. Enter usernames to allow specified users to view your private collections.
</Step>
<Step title="Set Collections to Public">
Go to the collection’s settings and enable Public Sharing to generate a sharable URL.

## 6. Common Privacy Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

- **Accidental Public Sharing:** Double-check your collection’s sharing status before sharing links externally.
- **Unintended Whitelist Exposure:** Only add usernames you trust to your whitelist to prevent unwanted access.
- **Outdated Export Files:** Regularly export backups; older files may not contain recent bookmarks.
- **Forgetting Password for Data Changes:** Password changes, including email updates, require password verification—never share or lose your password.

<Warning>
Always use strong, unique passwords and enable multi-factor authentication where possible to protect your account.
</Warning>
