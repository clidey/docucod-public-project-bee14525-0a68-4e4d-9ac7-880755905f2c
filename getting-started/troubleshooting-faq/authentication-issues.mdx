# Authentication & Access Issues

This guide provides clear, practical steps to help you resolve common problems related to signing in, password resets, email verification, handling Single Sign-On (SSO) errors, and managing permissions for both web and mobile clients of Linkwarden. Follow these instructions to quickly regain access and understand permission-related behaviors.

## 1. Understanding Sign-In Failures

If you are unable to sign in to Linkwarden, it’s essential to identify the root cause. The system supports multiple authentication methods including username/password, email verification, and various Single Sign-On providers.

### Common Reasons for Sign-In Failure

- **Incorrect username or password:** Check for typos or case sensitivity.
- **Unverified email address:** Your account requires verified email before allowing login.
- **SSO registration restrictions:** New users signing up through SSO might be disabled by admin.
- **Subscription or permission restrictions:** Active subscription and permissions are required.

<Tip>
If you see an "Invalid credentials" error, ensure you are entering the correct username or email and password. If you believe your credentials are correct, try resetting your password.
</Tip>

## 2. Resetting Your Password

If you cannot recall your password or suspect it is incorrect, follow these steps to reset it:

1. Navigate to the Linkwarden login page (`/login`).
2. Click the 'Forgot Password?' link.
3. Enter the email associated with your account.
4. Check your email inbox for the password reset link.
5. Follow the link and create a new password.
6. Return to the login page and sign in using your updated credentials.

<Warning>
Ensure your email address is verified before attempting password resets, as unverified emails can prevent the password reset process.
</Warning>

## 3. Verifying Your Email Address

If your email is not verified, signing in will fail for security reasons.

### Steps to Confirm or Re-Verify Email:

1. After registration or password reset, check your inbox for a verification email from Linkwarden.
2. Click the verification link within 20 minutes (verification links expire).
3. If you did not receive the email:
   - Check your spam/junk folder.
   - Request a new verification email from your account settings or during login.

<Note>
During sign-in, if you encounter an "Email not verified" error, you must complete email verification before proceeding.
</Note>

## 4. Handling Single Sign-On (SSO) Errors

Linkwarden supports various SSO providers such as Google, GitHub, Azure AD, and many others, configured by your administrator.

### Troubleshooting SSO Sign-In Issues:

- **New SSO users disabled:** Some deployments can prevent automatic registration of new SSO users.
  - If you are a new user using SSO and cannot sign up, contact your administrator.

- **Account linking problems:** If you already have an account but can't sign in with SSO, your provider account might not be linked.
  - Reach out to admin support to assist with account linking.

- **Expired or revoked tokens:** SSO tokens are time-limited.
  - Sign out and try signing in again to refresh tokens.

- **Missing permissions:** Your identity provider might not be supplying required profile fields.
  - Verify with your identity provider administrator.

<Tip>
Administrators can enable or disable new SSO user registration and manage linked accounts from the admin dashboard.
</Tip>

## 5. Checking Permission Settings

Access to Linkwarden features depends on your user permissions and subscription status.

### What to Check:

- **Active subscription:** Without an active subscription, sign-in might be blocked.
- **Verified email:** Required for all sign-in methods.
- **Session validity:** Logged-in sessions expire or can be revoked by admins.

### How to Verify Your Status:

1. If you can sign in but encounter access errors, check your user profile/settings page.
2. Contact your administrator for permission errors or subscription questions.

<Tip>
You can revoke active sessions or tokens from your account security settings to immediately regain control if you suspect unauthorized access.
</Tip>

## 6. Common Troubleshooting Steps

Follow this checklist to quickly solve authentication and access issues:

- **Confirm your username or email is correct (case-insensitive).**
- **Reset your password if necessary.**
- **Verify your email address through the link sent upon signup.**
- **Clear browser cache and cookies to remove corrupted sessions.**
- **Try signing in from a different browser or device.**
- **Check for any network restrictions or firewalls blocking authentication endpoints.**
- **Contact your administrator if using SSO and registration or linking fails.**

<Warning>
Avoid repeated failed sign-in attempts which may temporarily lock your account for security reasons.
</Warning>

## 7. Access Issues on Mobile Clients

If you use the Linkwarden mobile app and encounter login or access problems:

- Confirm your app is updated to the latest version.
- Ensure your device has stable internet connectivity.
- Logout and log back in to force a new session.
- Verify that your backend server URL or cloud connection is correctly configured in app settings.
- If SSO is enabled, use in-app browser or external browser login flows as instructed.

<Tip>
For mobile apps, cached sessions persist through app restarts; if experiencing persistent issues, clear app data or reinstall.
</Tip>

## 8. When to Contact Support

If none of the above steps restore access, collect the following information before contacting support:

- The exact error message displayed.
- Steps you took leading to the problem.
- Whether you use username/password or SSO.
- Device and browser/mobile app details.
- Approximate time the issue occurred.

Access support channels or community forums for personalized assistance.

## Appendix: Developer Notes on Authentication Flow

For those interested in the system's behavior:

- Credentials authentication is validated by the API endpoint `/api/v1/session`, which returns an error on invalid credentials or missing verification.

- New users via SSO can be disabled via `DISABLE_NEW_SSO_USERS` environment variable.

- Email verification protects users from unauthorized access.

- Sessions are managed with long-lived JSON Web Tokens (JWT), which can be revoked or expire.

- Token management API allows users to list, create, and revoke access tokens linked to sessions.
