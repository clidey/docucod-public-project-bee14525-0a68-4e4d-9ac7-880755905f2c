# Troubleshooting Common Setup Problems

Linkwarden aims to deliver a smooth onboarding experience, but like any sophisticated system, setup can occasionally encounter issues. This guide targets the most common problems during installation and your first run, helping you identify and resolve failures immediately. Whether you’re seeing deployment errors, environment misconfigurations, connection timeouts, or storage access issues, this guide walks you through actionable solutions.

---

## 1. Deployment Failures
If your deployment fails to start or crashes unexpectedly, follow these steps to diagnose and fix the problem.

### 1.1 Check Logs for Errors
- Review your container or server logs immediately after deployment.
- Look for error messages related to database connectivity, missing environment variables, or permission denials.

### 1.2 Common Causes & Fixes
- **Missing `.env` configuration**: Ensure your environment file is named correctly and loaded.
- **Port conflicts**: Verify that the server port (default 3000) is free.
- **Database connectivity**: Confirm `DATABASE_URL` is set correctly and the database server is reachable.

<Tip>
Maintain access to your deployment logs using your hosting provider's dashboard or use commands like `docker logs <container>` when relevant. This is your primary clue on what went wrong.
</Tip>

## 2. Environment Variable Misconfiguration
Linkwarden relies on environment variables for core operation, such as connecting to databases, external APIs, and enabling features.

### 2.1 Verify Essential Environment Variables
Ensure the required ones are set correctly according to your deployment type:
- `NEXTAUTH_URL`: Should point to your running backend URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth`)
- `DATABASE_URL`: Your PostgreSQL connection string
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: A secure random string

### 2.2 Common Pitfalls
- Typos or missing keys in `.env`
- Incorrect or incomplete URLs (e.g., missing protocol `http://`)
- Forgotten to restart the server after `.env` changes

### 2.3 How to Confirm Your Environment Variables Are Loaded
- Use your deployment method’s recommended approach (shell `printenv`, Docker `docker exec <container> env`).
- Verify that your backend logs reflect the variables (avoid exposing secrets).

<Check>
Always restart the Linkwarden backend service after modifying environment variables to ensure changes are effective.
</Check>

## 3. Database Connection Errors
Linkwarden requires a PostgreSQL database to store user data and bookmarks.

### 3.1 Symptoms
- Deployment log entries like `Error: failed to connect to PostgreSQL`
- Startup hanging or immediate crash

### 3.2 Solutions
- Confirm your database is running and accessible on targeted host and port
- Verify credentials and database name in `DATABASE_URL`

### 3.3 Testing Connectivity
From your Linkwarden host environment:

```bash
psql $DATABASE_URL
```

If this fails, inspect your Postgres instance settings, firewall rules, or credentials.

## 4. Storage & Access Failures
Linkwarden supports file storage for archived data and snapshots.

### 4.1 Common Issues
- Write permission denied to storage folder
- Misconfigured file storage path

### 4.2 Action Steps
- Confirm the folder path set in `STORAGE_FOLDER` exists and is writable by the Linkwarden process
- If containerized, ensure volumes are mapped correctly
- Check disk space availability

---

## 5. Authentication & Access Setup Issues
Problems logging in or registering are often traced back to environment misconfigurations or database problems.

### 5.1 Verify Email-Based Login Setup
- If using email login/verification, verify `EMAIL_FROM` and `EMAIL_SERVER` are correctly configured.
- Test sending emails manually or via logs.

### 5.2 Credentials Provider
- Confirm if `NEXT_PUBLIC_CREDENTIALS_ENABLED` is enabled to allow username/password logins.
- Verify password rules and hashing are respected.

<Tip>
Check your SMTP server settings carefully—incorrect ports, usernames, or service URLs will prevent email verification, blocking account setup.
</Tip>

---

## 6. Common First Run Issues

### 6.1 Demo Mode Restrictions
If you see errors like **"This action is disabled because this is a read-only demo of Linkwarden"**, it means the demo flag is active (`NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO=true`).

- To fix this, disable demo mode by setting `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO=false` in your environment and restart.

### 6.2 Rate Limits & API Errors
- Check for rate-limiting messages during token creation or API usage.
- This could result from misconfigured authentication tokens or backend limits.
