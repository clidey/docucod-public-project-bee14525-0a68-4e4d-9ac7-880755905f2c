# System Requirements

To ensure a smooth and reliable experience with Linkwarden, this guide outlines the essential hardware, software, and network prerequisites. Whether you plan to use Linkwarden as a cloud service or deploy it yourself, observing these requirements guarantees optimal performance and stability.

---

## 1. Supported Environments

Linkwarden supports two primary deployment scenarios:

- **Cloud Deployment (Linkwarden Hosted Service):** Access via web or mobile apps without local installation.
- **Self-Hosted Deployment:** Installing and running Linkwarden on your own infrastructure.

The requirements below cover both environments, with specific notes where necessary.

---

## 2. Hardware Requirements

### Cloud Usage
If you use Linkwarden’s hosted service, no local server hardware is required beyond the devices you use to access Linkwarden (e.g., computers, smartphones).

### Self-Hosted Deployment

| Component       | Minimum Specification                           | Recommended Specification                           | Notes                                  |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| CPU             | Quad-core 2.0 GHz or higher                     | Hexa-core 2.5 GHz or higher                         | Multi-core improves background archiving and AI processing |
| Memory (RAM)    | 4 GB                                           | 8 GB or more                                       | Ensures smooth operation with multiple users |
| Storage         | 20 GB disk space                               | SSD with 50+ GB available                           | Fast storage improves archive and database operations |
| Network         | Stable broadband connection                     | Gigabit Ethernet preferred (for on-premises servers) | Network speed impacts syncing and archival services |

---

## 3. Software Requirements

### Supported Operating Systems

- **Linux** distributions (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS+, Debian 11+, CentOS 8+)
- **Windows** 10 and above (for local client-side tools or desktop access)
- **macOS** 11 (Big Sur) and above

> Note: For self-hosted servers, Linux-based environments are recommended for robustness and compatibility.

### Runtime and Dependencies

- **Node.js:** Version 18.x or later (LTS recommended);
  Used for backend API and services.

- **Docker:** Version 20.x or later (optional but recommended for containerized deployment).

- **Database:** 
  - PostgreSQL 13 or higher (self-hosted deployments require a supported database engine).
  - Cloud users depend on hosted database—no action needed.

- **Web Browsers:** Latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge for web app access.

- **Mobile Platforms:**  
  - iOS 12.0 or later for iPhone/iPad apps
  - Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) or later for mobile app

---

## 4. Network & Connectivity Requirements

- **Internet Access:** Required for syncing, archiving, and AI tagging features.
- **Ports:** 
  - **HTTP(S):** Ports 80 and 443 open for web access and API communication.
  - **Database Access:** If self-hosted on a separate machine, ensure PostgreSQL port (default 5432) is open and secured.

- **Firewall Configuration:** Adjust firewall and security groups to allow inbound/outbound traffic for necessary ports.

- **Proxy Support:** Linkwarden supports operation behind proxies; configure environment variables accordingly.

---

## 5. Additional Considerations for Self-Hosted Deployments

- **Backup Storage:** Ensure adequate space and a backup strategy for database and archived web content.
- **SSL/TLS Certificates:** For secure HTTPS communication, configure valid SSL certificates.
- **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor CPU, memory, and disk IO to maintain stable performance.

---

## 6. Verifying Your Environment

Before installation or connecting to the cloud service:

1. Verify OS version:

```bash
uname -a  # Linux/macOS
systeminfo # Windows
```

2. Check Node.js version:

```bash
node -v
# Expected output: v18.x.x or higher
```

3. Confirm Docker installation and version (if using containers):

```bash
docker --version
# Expected output: Docker version 20.x.x
```

4. Validate PostgreSQL version (self-hosted deployments):

```bash
psql --version
# Expected: 13 or later
```

5. Test network connectivity to required ports:

```bash
curl -I https://your-linkwarden-instance.com
# Should return headers without error
```

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common System Requirements Issues">
<Accordion title="Node.js Not Found or Incorrect Version">
Ensure Node.js is installed and on version 18 or later. Use the Node.js official site or your OS package manager to upgrade.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Docker Not Running or Not Installed">
Docker must be installed and running correctly if deploying via containers. Restart Docker service or reinstall if errors persist.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Insufficient Disk Space or Permissions">
Check permissions and available disk space on persistent storage directories and database locations. Correct permissions to allow service access.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Network Ports Blocked by Firewall">
Verify firewall settings allow traffic on HTTP/HTTPS and PostgreSQL ports. For cloud access, ensure your local firewall does not block ports 80 and 443.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
