# Choosing Your Deployment: Cloud vs. Self-Hosted

Deciding how to deploy Linkwarden is a critical first step that shapes your experience, control, cost, and maintenance efforts. This page guides you through the differences between the hassle-free managed Cloud option and the powerful customizable Self-Hosted approach. Understanding these options helps you choose the best path aligned to your needs.

---

## 1. Overview: Deployment Options at a Glance

Linkwarden offers two primary deployment routes:

- **Cloud Deployment (Managed Service):** Use Linkwarden’s hosted infrastructure. We handle hosting, scaling, backups, and maintenance so you can focus on using the product.
- **Self-Hosted Deployment:** Run and manage a full Linkwarden instance on your own servers or cloud accounts. This option gives you maximum control and customization but requires technical expertise and operational responsibility.

### Why This Choice Matters

Choosing a deployment option affects:

- How quickly you start using Linkwarden
- Your ongoing operational workload
- Control over data, security, and customization
- Total cost of ownership


## 2. Cloud Deployment: Ease & Convenience

### What You Get

- Fully managed hosting on Linkwarden’s secure cloud infrastructure
- Automatic updates and maintenance
- Scalable performance that adapts to your usage
- Regular backups and disaster recovery handled for you
- Seamless onboarding without installation or system requirements

### Benefits

- **Zero setup time:** Get started immediately without worrying about infrastructure
- **No operational overhead:** Maintenance, patching, scaling, and backups are handled by us
- **Cost-effective for individual users and small teams:** Pay a simple subscription without infrastructure costs
- **Instant access to new features and security updates**

### Trade-Offs

- **Less customization:** Limited ability to modify backend or integrations
- **Data resides off-site:** Your bookmarks and data are hosted in Linkwarden’s cloud
- **Dependent on internet connectivity and cloud service stability**

<Tip>
Cloud deployment is ideal if you want to start fast, avoid infrastructure headaches, and use Linkwarden immediately with minimal management.
</Tip>


## 3. Self-Hosted Deployment: Control & Customizability

### What You Get

- Full installation of the Linkwarden backend and related services on your choice of infrastructure (on-premises servers, private cloud, or public cloud providers)
- Complete control over configuration, custom features, and integrations
- Direct ownership of all data and how it is stored
- Ability to configure security policies and backups to your corporate standards

### Benefits

- **Total autonomy:** Customize the system to suit unique workflows or corporate policies
- **Enhanced data privacy and compliance:** Keep all data within your controlled environment
- **Potential cost savings for large scale or long-term use:** Avoid subscription fees by managing your own infrastructure

### Trade-Offs

- **Requires technical skills:** Installation, configuration, updates, and ongoing operations are your responsibility
- **Operational overhead:** You must handle backups, updates, performance monitoring, and security hardening
- **Initial setup time and complexity can be significant**

<Warning>
Self-hosting is recommended only if your team has technical expertise or dedicated resources for managing server infrastructure.
</Warning>


## 4. Compare and Align Your Priorities

| Aspect            | Cloud Deployment                  | Self-Hosted Deployment            |
|-------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Setup Speed       | Minutes to start, no installs     | Hours to days; includes installs  |
| Maintenance       | Fully managed by Linkwarden      | Fully managed by you              |
| Customization     | Limited to app features          | Full backend and integration control|
| Cost Structure    | Subscription-based               | Infrastructure and maintenance costs|
| Security & Privacy| Data stored by Linkwarden        | Data stays within your control    |
| Scaling           | Automatic and elastic            | Manual, depends on your infrastructure|

## 6. Next Steps

- To proceed with Cloud Deployment, visit the [Account Setup and First Login](/getting-started/configuration-initial-setup/account-setup-login) page to create your account and start using Linkwarden.
- For Self-Hosting, proceed to the [Self-Hosted Installation](/getting-started/requirements-installation/self-hosted-installation) guide for detailed setup instructions.
- Learn more about environment and backend configuration on the [Backend & Environment Configuration](/getting-started/configuration-initial-setup/environment-configuration) page.


## 7. Troubleshooting Deployment Choices

<AccordionGroup title="Common Questions">
<Accordion title="Can I change from Cloud to Self-Hosted later?">
Yes. You can export your data from the cloud version and import it into your self-hosted instance. The migration process is documented in the import-export guide.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What if I have limited technical skills but want to self-host?">
Self-hosting requires at least basic server administration knowledge. If you are unsure, consider the Cloud option or seek assistance from your IT team.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Are there cost differences between the two?">
Cloud deployment incurs subscription fees with no infrastructure costs, ideal for predictable budgeting. Self-hosting may reduce license fees but requires infrastructure, power, and maintenance costs.
</Accordion>

# Callouts
<Tip>
Consider your team size, technical capacity, and data sensitivity before deciding your deployment approach. Cloud is fast and easy; self-hosted offers maximum control.
</Tip>
<Warning>
Self-hosted deployments require ongoing maintenance. Neglecting updates or backups can impact security and reliability.
</Warning>
<Note>
If unsure, start with Cloud deployment to evaluate Linkwarden’s value before committing significant resources to self-hosting.
</Note>
