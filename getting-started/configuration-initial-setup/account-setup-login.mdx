# Account Setup and First Login

Welcome to Linkwarden! This guide walks you through creating your first account, understanding authentication options, and performing your initial login, whether you're using the cloud service or a self-hosted instance. By the end, you'll confidently access your Linkwarden dashboard and be ready to start managing your bookmarks securely.

## 1. Understanding Linkwarden Authentication

Linkwarden supports multiple authentication methods tailored to your deployment preferences:

- **Cloud Users**: Typically use email-password or OAuth via providers like Google, GitHub, or Apple.
- **Self-Hosted Users**: Can choose credential-based login or configure external Single Sign-On providers (SSO) such as Azure AD, Auth0, or other OAuth/OpenID Connect systems.

These options ensure secure access and flexibility depending on your organization's needs.

<Note>
If your deployment administrator has disabled registrations or SSO user creation is restricted, please contact your system administrator for account provisioning.
</Note>

## 2. Creating Your First Account

### For Cloud Users

1. Navigate to the Linkwarden cloud sign-up page at [https://cloud.linkwarden.app/register](https://cloud.linkwarden.app/register).
2. Fill out the registration form with your display name, username or email (depending on the service configuration), and set a strong password.
3. Confirm your password and submit the form.
4. Check your email for a verification link.
5. Click the verification link in the email to activate your account.

<Tip>
Use a unique, strong password and verify your email promptly to ensure smooth onboarding.
</Tip>

### For Self-Hosted Users

1. If registration is enabled:
   - Open your self-hosted instance URL and go to the registration page.
   - Provide the requested details (name, username/email, password).
2. If registration is disabled:
   - Your administrator must create your account manually or enable registration.
3. For some self-hosted setups, you may need to wait for an invitation email to join an organization or team.

<Warning>
Attempting to register while disabled will result in an error. Reach out to your administrator if you encounter issues.
</Warning>

## 3. Performing Your Initial Login

After your account is created and email is verified, follow these steps to log in:

### Step-by-Step Login Process

1. Go to the login page: For cloud users, [https://cloud.linkwarden.app/login](https://cloud.linkwarden.app/login). For self-hosted, use your instance’s `/login` URL.
2. Enter your username or email as prompted.
3. Enter your password.
4. Click the **Login** button.
5. Upon successful login, you will be redirected to your Linkwarden dashboard.

### Using Third-Party Authentication

If your deployment enables OAuth providers (Google, GitHub, Apple, etc.), you will also see buttons for these options at login:

- Click the relevant provider button.
- Complete the OAuth or SSO flow.
- You will be redirected automatically to Linkwarden upon successful authentication.

If you see no option to register or login, verify with your administrator that the service is properly configured.

## 4. Email Verification Flow

Email verification is mandatory for most deployments to confirm account ownership.

- After registration, Linkwarden sends a verification email.
- The email contains a unique link with a token.
- Clicking the link will confirm your email and activate your account.
- You will be signed out after verification and should log in afresh.

<Tip>
Check your spam folder if the verification email does not appear within a few minutes.
