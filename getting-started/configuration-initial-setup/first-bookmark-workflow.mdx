## 3. Archiving & Annotation

Linkwarden’s strong preservation features ensure your bookmarks are preserved exactly as you see them.

### 3.1 How Archiving Works

- After saving a bookmark, Linkwarden automatically creates a permanent archive based on your configured preferences (screenshots, PDFs, monoliths).
- Archives are stored securely in designated folders associated with each collection.
- This enables offline reading and guard against link rot.

### 3.2 Adding Highlights and Notes

Once your bookmark is saved:

- Open the bookmark detail view to read the archived content.
- Use the highlighting tools to mark important text segments.
- Add comments or annotations to capture your thoughts or insights.

These annotations become searchable and sharable within Linkwarden.

<Tip>
Start by highlighting a few key ideas to test annotation; it helps reinforce your knowledge and makes collaboration with teammates richer.
</Tip>

## 4. Retrieving and Managing Your Bookmark

### 4.1 Browsing Your Collections

- Navigate to the collection where you saved your bookmark.
- Use filters and search by tags or text to quickly locate your bookmark.

### 4.2 Viewing the Archive

- Access the archived version directly from the bookmark's detail view with no dependency on the live webpage.
- Review your annotations and highlights inline.

### 4.3 Editing and Organizing

- Rename, retag, or move bookmarks between collections at any time.
- Pin important bookmarks to the top for fast access.

<Tip>
Regularly review and curate your collections to maintain an organized knowledge base.
</Tip>
