# Quick Validation & Health Check

Ensure your Linkwarden deployment is fully functional by performing these essential validation and health checks. This guide walks you through verifying core server status, API responsiveness, background job operation, and storage health. Completing these checks early uncovers hidden problems, giving you confidence before proceeding to add bookmarks or collaborate.

---

## 1. Overview

Validating your deployment ensures all key components are running correctly and communicating as expected. This step is critical for both cloud and self-hosted installations, helping prevent disruptions during daily use.

Key Checks Include:
- Confirming the backend server is operational
- Testing core APIs for proper responses
- Checking that background processes like archiving jobs are running
- Verifying storage system accessibility and health

These checks provide a clean baseline, letting you proceed with account creation, bookmarking, and collaborations with confidence.

---

## 2. Prerequisites

Before beginning these checks, ensure:

- Your Linkwarden backend is installed and started according to the [Self-Hosted Installation guide](/getting-started/requirements-installation/self-hosted-installation) or you have access to the cloud service.
- Environment configuration is complete, with all required environment variables set as described in [Environment Configuration](/getting-started/configuration-initial-setup/environment-configuration).
- You have network access to your Linkwarden server and APIs.
- You have proper credentials for authentication (or demo mode enabled).

---

## 3. Server Status Validation

Perform a basic connectivity and status check to confirm the backend is running and responding.

### Step 1: Ping the Dashboard API

Run this GET request to verify the core dashboard endpoint responds:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://your-linkwarden-domain/api/v2/dashboard" -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN"
```

Expected Outcome:
- HTTP status 200
- JSON response containing dashboard data, e.g., collections, links summary

If you receive a 401 Unauthorized, ensure your token is valid.
If you receive no response or a server error, the backend may not be running or is blocked.

### Step 2: Check API Root Status

Some deployments expose a health or status endpoint (check your deployment's setup). Alternatively, test other key API endpoints listed below.

---

## 4. API Connectivity & Functionality Check

Validate that the main APIs can be reached and respond correctly.

### Testing Users API

Retrieve current user information:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://your-linkwarden-domain/api/v1/users/me" -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN"
```

Expected Result:
- HTTP status 200
- JSON with user details like id, username, email

### Testing Collections API

Get the list of collections for your user:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://your-linkwarden-domain/api/v1/collections" -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN"
```

Expected Result:
- HTTP status 200
- JSON array of collection objects

### Testing Session Creation (for login validation)

Validate credentials and session creation:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-linkwarden-domain/api/v1/session" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"your_username","password":"your_password","sessionName":"test-session"}'
```

Expected Result:
- HTTP status 200
- JSON response with session token

### Troubleshooting API Requests

- If you get status 400 or relevant error messages, verify your authentication token or credentials.
- For network errors, confirm your server is accessible and firewall rules allow traffic.

## 5. Background Jobs Health Check

Linkwarden relies on background processes to handle tasks like web archiving, PDF/screenshot generation, and cleanup.

### Step 1: Confirm Background Job Worker Process

- For self-hosted, ensure the worker process/service is running (see deployment documentation).
- Check logs for errors related to background jobs.

### Step 2: Trigger an Archival Task

Add a test bookmark and request archival (e.g., screenshot or PDF). Then:

- Verify the archival files appear in the storage location.
- Check that the archived files have proper permissions and are accessible.

### Step 3: Verify Job Queueing

If your deployment supports a job dashboard or logging, confirm jobs queue and complete without failure.

---

## 6. Storage Health Check

Your archival storage (local disk, cloud bucket) must be available and writable.

### Step 1: Verify Storage Access

- SSH or access your storage location (for local filesystem or cloud storage).
- Confirm read/write permissions.

### Step 2: Test File Upload and Retrieval

Upload a test file using the archives API or UI, then attempt to retrieve it via the archive endpoint:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://your-linkwarden-domain/api/v1/archives/12345?format=1" -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN"
```

Expected Result:
- Successfully download or view the archived file.

## 7. Sample Quick Validation Workflow

<Steps>
<Step title="Login and Get Token">
Obtain an authentication token by logging in through the session API with your username and password.
</Step>
<Step title="Fetch User Profile">
Use the token to request the /users/me endpoint and validate user details.
</Step>
<Step title="Retrieve Collections">
Confirm collections load properly using the /collections endpoint.
</Step>
<Step title="Test Dashboard API">
Ping the /dashboard endpoint to check overall status and summaries.
</Step>
<Step title="Add Test Bookmark and Archive">
Add a bookmark from the UI or API, trigger archiving, and check storage for files.
</Step>
<Step title="Retrieve Archived Files">
Download the archived file to confirm storage and retrieval integrity.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 8. Common Issues & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common Deployment Issues">
<Accordion title="401 Unauthorized Errors">
This indicates incorrect or missing authentication token. Double-check your token and ensure it has not expired.

- Regenerate tokens via the tokens API if necessary.
- Verify your API calls include the Authorization header.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Server Not Responding or Timeout">
- Confirm backend server process is running.
- Check firewall and network rules.
- Review server logs for crashes or errors.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Archival Files Not Generated or Missing">
- Ensure background job worker is running.
- Verify storage directory permissions.
- Check job queue logs for errors.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="API Returns 400 or Validation Errors">
- Validate JSON request payloads match expected schema.
- Review error messages returned by API for clues.
</Accordion>

## 9. Next Steps

Once this health check passes smoothly, you are ready to:

- Proceed with [Account Setup and Login](/getting-started/configuration-initial-setup/account-setup-login).
- Start adding bookmarks as described in [Your First Bookmark Workflow](/getting-started/configuration-initial-setup/first-bookmark-workflow).
- Explore organizing and sharing bookmarks through collections.

For any issues found during validation, consult the [Troubleshooting Common Setup Problems](/getting-started/troubleshooting-faq/common-setup-issues) guide or seek support via community and support channels.
