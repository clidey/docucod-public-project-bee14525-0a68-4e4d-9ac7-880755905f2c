## 1. Auto-Archival Formats

Linkwarden now supports new automated archival formats, expanding how your bookmarks’ content is preserved for long-term access:

- **PDF Archival**: Capture entire webpages into PDF documents automatically, ensuring faithful offline replicas.
- **Screenshot Archival**: Generate high-quality screenshots alongside links, providing visual snapshots.

### Why It Matters
These archival formats reduce manual effort to save valuable content in formats convenient for diverse workflows — from research to documentation — enhancing your ability to preserve and reference web content in richer, more accessible ways.

### Best Practices
- Enable auto-archival in your settings to immediately benefit from seamless preservation.
- Use PDF archive copies for offline reading or sharing.
- Screenshots serve as quick visual references, especially when webpages dynamically change.

### Common Pitfalls
- Archival success depends on site accessibility and fetch reliability; occasional failures may require manual retry.
- Large PDFs may increase storage use — monitor quotas accordingly.

### User Benefits

- Improves discoverability through consistent, relevant tagging.

### Best Practices

- Review and adjust AI-generated tags to fine-tune classification over time.
