# What is Linkwarden?

Linkwarden is a powerful, self-hosted bookmarking platform that helps individuals and teams capture, organize, preserve, and collaborate on online content. At its heart, Linkwarden transforms traditional bookmarking from a simple list of URLs into a rich, interactive, and secure knowledge repository where you can save full web pages, annotate, tag, and share curated collections—all in one unified platform.

## Why Use Linkwarden?

Have you ever lost a valuable article or reference because a website changed or disappeared? Or struggled to keep your bookmarks organized and accessible, especially when collaborating with others? Linkwarden solves these problems by not merely saving links but capturing the content behind those links permanently, creating a trustworthy, searchable library. 

### Key Benefits for You

- **Preserve Web Content Permanently:** Beyond saving URLs, Linkwarden archives snapshots and readable versions of pages so you can revisit exactly what you saved, even if the original site is gone or changed.
- **Collaborate Seamlessly:** Build shared collections with your colleagues or friends, allowing everyone to contribute and discover together.
- **Organize Intuitively:** Use collections, tags, highlights, and AI-assisted categorization to keep your bookmarks orderly and easy to find.
- **Access Anywhere:** Whether through web, mobile, or browser extensions, your links and archives are always at hand.

## What Can You Do on Linkwarden?

### 1. Save and Archive Links
Simply add URLs, PDFs, or images, and Linkwarden automatically captures the content in multiple archive formats (screenshots, PDFs, readable text, and more). Your content is preserved fully, so reading or referencing later is reliable and fast.

### 2. Organize with Collections and Tags
Group bookmarks into Collections—personal folders or shared team spaces—and assign tags and AI-generated categories to streamline discovery.

### 3. Highlight and Annotate
Interact with saved content by highlighting important passages and adding notes, making it easier to reflect and collaborate.

### 4. Collaborate and Share
Invite team members to contribute, manage permissions, and even share public links or collections with external audiences.

### 5. Import and Export
Bring bookmarks from other services like Wallabag, Omnivore, Pocket, or existing Linkwarden backups. Export your data anytime for backup or migration.

## How Linkwarden Fits in Your Workflow

Imagine you’re conducting research or managing projects:

- You find an insightful article and bookmark it in Linkwarden.
- The system archives the full webpage instantly.
- You organize it into a “Project XYZ” collection.
- Later, you highlight key points directly in Linkwarden and tag with “priority” or “research.”
- Your team accesses the same collection, adding resources and annotations.

This effortless preservation, organization, and collaboration empower you to maintain your knowledge base reliably.
