# User Management and Permissions

Manage your team effectively by inviting users, managing accounts, assigning roles, and controlling access to collections and resources. This guide helps administrators and collection owners set up secure collaboration environments in Linkwarden.

---

## 1. Understanding User Management and Permissions

Managing users and their permissions is crucial to maintaining a secure and efficient collaborative environment. This page covers the essential workflows administrators and collection owners use to invite members, assign roles, and control access.

### What This Page Covers
- Inviting new users to your team or collections
- Overview of user roles and their permissions
- Managing existing users and memberships
- Controlling access rights to collections and content

### Who Should Use This Guide
- Team administrators who manage seats and subscriptions
- Collection owners responsible for delegate access and collaboration

## 2. Inviting Users

### Why Invite Users?
Inviting users grants them access to shared collections and enables collaboration. When an invitation is accepted, a new seat is added to your subscription, and billing is automatically adjusted.

### How to Invite Users
<Steps>
<Step title="Open User Management Interface">
Navigate to your team's user management panel by selecting 'Users Administration' in the application menu.
</Step>
<Step title="Enter Invitee Email">
Enter the email address of the person you want to invite into the invitation field.
</Step>
<Step title="Note Cost Impact">
Be aware that accepting the invitation will increase your subscription seat count, incurring additional monthly or annual costs based on your current plan.
</Step>
<Step title="Send Invitation">
Click 'Send Invitation' to email the invitee a link to join your team.
</Step>
</Steps>

### What Happens Next
- The invitee receives an email with a sign-up link.
- They complete account setup using the link.
- Your account is billed for the new seat.

### Tips for Inviting
- Confirm email addresses carefully to avoid sending invitations to wrong recipients.
- Communicate internally to inform invitees about the invitation and their next steps.

## 3. User Roles and Permissions

Linkwarden offers predefined roles for users in collections, defining their access and capabilities.

| Role       | Description                              | Permissions                             |
|------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Owner      | Full ownership of the collection         | Manage members, settings, delete collection
| Admin      | Full access to all links within collection | View, create, edit, delete links       |
| Contributor| Can view and create links                 | View links, add new links               |
| Viewer     | Read-only access                         | View links only                        |

### Role Assignment
- Owners assign roles when adding members to collections.
- Roles can be updated or revoked at any time by owners.

### Best Practices
- Assign the minimum necessary permissions to users to uphold security principles.
- Reserve Owner role for trusted users who manage the collection.

## 4. Managing Existing Users

### Viewing Members
- Access the 'View Team' or 'Members' section within a collection or the administration dashboard.
- See list of current users, their roles, subscription status, and date added.

### Modifying Membership
- To change a user's role, select their entry and adjust permissions accordingly.
- To remove users, select 'Remove Member' and confirm the action.

### Removing Users
- Removing a user revokes their access to the collection.
- They need an active subscription to regain access if re-invited.
- Removal is irreversible; proceed carefully.

### Tips
- Regularly audit user lists to ensure only active collaborators have access.
- Use removal confirmation dialogs as safeguards against accidental deletions.

## 5. Controlling Access to Collections

### Public vs Private Collections
- You can make a collection public to allow anyone to view its contents and members.
- Private collections restrict access only to invited users.

### Sharing Links
- Publicly shared collections have a sharable link that can be distributed freely.
- Private collections require explicit membership.

### Permissions Inheritance
- User permissions apply to collections and their sub-collections.
- Changing a user's role affects their access throughout the collection hierarchy.

### Best Practices
- Use public sharing sparingly and for collections intended for broad access.
- Keep sensitive data within private collections governed by strict roles.

## 6. Tips and Common Pitfalls

- **Invitation Emails Not Received:** Ask invitees to check spam folders; consider resending invitations if needed.
- **Role Confusion:** Clearly communicate role capabilities and limitations to users.
- **Accidental User Removal:** Use the confirmation prompt; hold Shift while deleting to optionally skip confirmation but do so cautiously.
- **Subscription Costs:** Monitor purchased seats in 'Manage Seats' to avoid unexpected charges.
