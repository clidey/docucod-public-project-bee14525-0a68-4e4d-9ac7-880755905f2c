# Creating and Managing Collaborative Collections

Collaborative collections are key to unlocking shared knowledge and teamwork in Linkwarden. This guide walks you through setting up collections designed for collaboration within your team or group, inviting members, managing permissions, and best practices for shared organization. By following these steps, you will create effective collaborative spaces that empower smooth teamwork and streamlined link management.

## Workflow Overview

### Task Description
Learn how to create collections intended for group use, invite collaborators with appropriate permissions, and maintain effective collaborative workflows in Linkwarden.

### Prerequisites
- A Linkwarden account with appropriate permissions to create and manage collections.
- Basic familiarity with Linkwarden’s general concepts such as collections and links.
- Access to the web or mobile app where collections can be created and managed.

### Expected Outcome
- A collaborative collection ready for team use.
- Team members invited and assigned permissions to contribute or manage the collection.
- Understanding of how to update, manage members, and remove a collection or leave it.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 10-20 minutes to create and configure a collaborative collection and invite team members.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate — requires understanding of permissions and collaborative workflows.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Create a New Collaborative Collection

1. In Linkwarden, navigate to the collections area via the sidebar or collections menu.
2. Click the **Create New Collection** button.
3. Enter a descriptive **Name** and optional **Description** that helps your team understand the collection's purpose.
4. Customize the collection's appearance by choosing a **Color** and **Icon** to visually represent the collection.
5. If applicable, set a **Parent Collection** to create a nested, hierarchical structure to organize collections.
6. Toggle the **Public** setting only if you want the collection to be publicly accessible.
7. Click **Create** to save the collection.

**Result:** The new collection appears in your list and is ready for collaboration setup.

### 2. Add Members to Collaborate

1. Open the newly created collection.
2. Go to the **Members** or **Collaborators** section within the collection settings.
3. Click **Add Member**.
4. Enter the username or email address of the team member you want to invite.
5. Assign permissions for the invitee:
   - **Can Create**: Allows adding new links or sub-collections.
   - **Can Update**: Permits editing collection details or links.
   - **Can Delete**: Grants rights to remove links or the collection.
6. Confirm the invitation to send an access request to the team member.

**Tip:** Avoid assigning delete permissions broadly to minimize accidental data loss.

### 3. Manage Collaborative Permissions

- Regularly review the **Members** list to verify roles and update permissions as the team’s needs evolve.
- Use the **Update Collection** option to modify collection name, description, or sharing settings anytime.
- Use **Remove Member** to revoke access when collaboration on a project or collection ends.

### 4. Leave or Delete a Collaborative Collection

- To **leave** a collection you no longer need access to, remove yourself via the members list (if not the owner).
- To **delete** a collection, only collection owners have the privilege:
  - Navigate to the collection settings.
  - Click **Delete Collection**.
  - Confirm deletion. Be aware this action removes all contained links and sub-collections irreversibly.

**Warning:** Deleting a collection affects all collaborators. Confirm this action carefully.

### 5. Organizing Collaborative Collections Best Practices

- Use clear and consistent naming conventions for collections for easy identification.
- Leverage nested collections for complex projects to maintain clarity.
- Define and communicate permission levels explicitly with your team.
- Regularly archive or clean up obsolete collections to keep the workspace tidy.

## Examples & Scenarios

### Example: Creating a Research Project Collection for a Team

1. Create a collection named "Climate Change Research" with a relevant icon and green color.
2. Add your research team members, granting them **Can Create** and **Can Update** permissions but withholding delete permissions.
3. Organize links into sub-collections like "Data Sources," "Articles," and "Reports."
4. Use this shared collection as the central hub for saving and annotating valuable resources collaboratively.

### Example: Inviting a New Contributor

- Invite a new team member by their email.
- Assign only **Can Create** rights if their role is to add links but not modify collection metadata.
- Update permissions later as needed.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues

- **Cannot add a member:** Verify you have the necessary owner or admin permissions on the collection.
- **Invited member doesn’t receive access:** Confirm the invitee has a Linkwarden account or ask them to register.
- **Permission changes not saving:** Ensure your internet connection is stable and retry. Check for any read-only demo mode restrictions.

### Best Practices

- Use descriptive collection names to avoid confusion in large teams.
- Limit permissions thoughtfully — assign delete permissions sparingly to protect data integrity.
- When removing members, communicate changes clearly to your team.
- Regularly back up important collections if possible.

### Performance Considerations

- Large collections with many collaborators and links may load more slowly; organize content into sub-collections when possible.

### Alternative Approaches

- For one-off sharing, consider using public sharing features instead of collaborative collections.

<AccordionGroup title="API & Technical Underpinnings">
<Accordion title="Creating a Collection (API)">
You can create collections via the API endpoint `/api/v1/collections` using a POST request. The payload includes parameters such as name, description, color, icon, and optionally parent collection ID. The API validates ownership and permissions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Updating Collections and Members">
Updates to collections, including renaming or changing members, use the PUT method at `/api/v1/collections/{id}`. You must have owner permissions to modify collections. Members can be added with specific permission flags such as `canCreate`, `canUpdate`, and `canDelete`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Deleting or Leaving Collections">
Deletion requests are sent to `/api/v1/collections/{id}` with the DELETE method. Only owners can delete collections. Members who are not owners can remove themselves (leave) by deleting their membership link. Collections with sub-collections and links are recursively cleaned up.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
