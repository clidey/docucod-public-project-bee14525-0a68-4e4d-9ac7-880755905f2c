## Understanding Public Sharing in Linkwarden

### What Can Be Shared Publicly?
- **Single Links:** Any link residing in a collection marked as public can be shared individually.
- **Collections:** Entire sets of links grouped together can be published as public collections.

### Who Can See Public Content?
- Publicly shared links and collections are accessible to anyone with the public link URL—no login required.
- Collections must be explicitly marked as public by their owners or authorized members.

### Privacy Controls
- Only collections with the "Public" flag enabled expose their contents.
- Individual links inherit the visibility of their parent collection.
- Sensitive or private collections remain inaccessible unless you change their visibility settings.

## Step-By-Step Instructions

### 1. Publishing a Collection Publicly

1. **Navigate to Collections:**
   - Open the Linkwarden web app.
   - Go to the Collections page from the sidebar.

2. **Select the Collection:**
   - Click on the collection you want to share.

3. **Enable Public Access:**
   - Inside the collection settings, locate the visibility option.
   - Toggle the "Make this collection public" switch to ON.
   - Confirm any prompts about public visibility.

4. **Copy Public Share Link:**
   - After enabling public mode, Linkwarden generates a unique public URL.
   - Use the "Copy link" button to grab the URL for distribution.

5. **Share the URL:**
   - Distribute this URL via email, chat, or embed it in documents.

**Expected Result:** Anyone with this URL can view the collection and its links without logging in.

### 2. Sharing Individual Links Publicly

Single links can be made public if they belong to a public collection.

1. **Ensure Parent Collection is Public:**
   - Confirm the collection containing the link is marked public (see Steps above).

2. **Access the Link's Details:**
   - Open the link from your Links dashboard.

3. **Copy Public Link URL:**
   - If the collection is public, you can retrieve the public URL for this individual link.
   - Use the "Share" or "Details" options to find and copy the public URL.

4. **Share the Link:**
   - This URL can be sent to anyone; they can view the link details and preserved content without authentication.

**Expected Result:** Public users can access the link info and archived versions via the public page.

---

### 3. Using Public View Formats

Linkwarden supports different public view formats optimized for various use cases:

- **List View:** A straightforward list of links and metadata.
- **Detailed View:** Shows extended details including annotations, tags, and archive previews.
- **Read-Only Archive View:** Allows reading preserved webpage snapshots directly on the public page.

To choose or switch between these views:

- Settings may automatically detect the best format based on collection content.
- Currently, public pages default to a user-friendly combined view.

---

### 4. Best Practices When Sharing Public Links or Collections

- **Review Content Before Publishing:** Double-check no sensitive information is included in public collections.
- **Manage Permissions Carefully:** Only owners or collaborators with publishing rights can enable public access.
- **Use Descriptive Collection Names:** Clear titles help your audience understand the content context.
- **Update Links Regularly:** Keep public links and collections current for relevance.
- **Monitor Usage:** Track which links are shared and remove public access if needed.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Public Sharing Troubleshooting">
<Accordion title="I can't find the option to make my collection public">
Ensure you have "Owner" or "Can Update" permissions for the collection. Only authorized users can toggle public visibility settings.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Public links show a "Permission Denied" message">
Verify the parent collection is set to public. Individual links inherit visibility from their collections. If the collection isn't public, links cannot be shared publicly.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Public page does not load correctly or is blank">
Clear your browser cache or try accessing the URL in a private/incognito window. Check if the collection or link still exists and is public.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Public URL is incorrect or broken">
Copy the public share link directly from the Linkwarden interface after enabling public access. Avoid modifying the URL manually.
