## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Accessing Reader View for a Saved Link
- Navigate to the desired saved link either from your dashboard, a collection, or via search.
- Click on the link's title to open its detailed page.
- If the link has preserved readable content (indicated by the presence of archived text), the reader view will automatically load a clean, formatted version of the page.
- If readable content is not yet available, a placeholder message will inform you that preservation is in progress.

**Expected Result:** The primary content of the link appears in a clean, distraction-free format optimized for reading.

---

### 2. Navigating and Reading in Reader Mode
- The reader view presents the content with enhanced typography based on your preferences (font family, size, line height, and width).
- The title, original URL, and date information appear clearly to provide context.
- Adjust your reading preferences in your user settings if needed to improve comfort.

**Expected Result:** Comfortable reading experience tailored to your style.

---

### 3. Selecting Text to Highlight
- Use your mouse or touch interface to select a segment of text worth noting.
- When you release the selection (mouse up or touch end), a contextual menu will appear near your text.

**Expected Result:** The highlight menu displays color options and actions to add notes.

**Important:** Only selections within the readable content container are accepted for highlight creation.

---

### 4. Creating a Highlight
- In the highlight menu, choose a color (yellow, red, blue, or green) to mark your selection.
- Optionally, click the comment icon (chat bubble) to add a textual note explaining the significance or context of your highlight.
- After adding your comment, click Save to persist your annotation.

**Outcome:** Your selection is highlighted with color and annotation, if provided.

Hints:
- Highlights with comments are underlined with a colored border for easy visual identification.
- You can cancel the comment addition anytime before saving.

---

### 5. Editing or Deleting Highlights
- Click on an existing highlight to open the contextual menu.
- You may change its color or add/edit a comment.
- To delete, click the trash icon in the menu.
- Confirm deletion to remove the highlight permanently.

**Expected Result:** Highlights update live and synchronize across your devices.

---

### 6. Reviewing All Highlights and Notes
- Open the highlight drawer by clicking the notes/highlights icon (or navigate to the highlights sidebar).
- Browse through all saved highlights for the current link.
- Each highlight entry shows the highlighted text snippet, comment (if any), creation date, and color-coded border.
- Use this drawer to quickly jump to highlights or delete unwanted notes.

**Outcome:** Centralized overview for managing your annotations efficiently.

---

### 7. Exporting or Sharing Highlights (Optional)
- While the current page does not directly support exporting, you can copy text and comments manually.
- Use Linkwarden’s public sharing or collaboration features (covered in related docs) to share annotations with team members as needed.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Select carefully:** Highlight only meaningful, concise segments to keep notes clear and relevant.
- **Use colors purposefully:** Assign colors for different categories or importance levels for easier scanning later.
- **Leverage comments:** Add context or reflections to highlighted excerpts to enrich your understanding.
- **Refresh reader content:** If reader mode is empty, ensure the link archive is complete; bookmark and wait for preservation to finish.
- **Avoid overlapping highlights:** Overlapping text selections may cause display issues; work with non-overlapping segments for clarity.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Reader and Highlighting">
<Accordion title="Reader view is empty or says 'preservation in queue'">
This means the archived readable content isn't ready yet. Wait a few minutes and refresh or check back later.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Cannot create or save highlights">
Check your user permissions for the collection. Ensure you have update rights on the collection containing the link.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Highlight menu not appearing on text selection">
Confirm you are selecting text inside the readable content area only. Using browser extensions or strict security settings could interfere; try disabling conflicting extensions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Highlights disappear or do not persist">
Make sure you are logged in and your internet connection is stable. Highlight data syncs live; reload the page if needed. Contact support if the issue persists.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Comments not saving or updating">
Comments on highlights require a working backend; check if Linkwarden DEMO mode is active (which disables writes). Also verify if you have sufficient collection permissions.
