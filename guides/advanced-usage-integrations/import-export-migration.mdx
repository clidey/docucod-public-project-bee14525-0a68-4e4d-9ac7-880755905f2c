## 2. Supported Formats for Import and Export

Linkwarden supports importing bookmarks from various popular formats and services. Understanding these will help you prepare your data appropriately.

| Format           | File Extension(s) | Description                                      |
|------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Linkwarden JSON  | `.json`           | Native format for backup and restore within Linkwarden |
| HTML Bookmark     | `.html`           | Standard export from most browsers and bookmark managers |
| Pocket CSV       | `.csv`            | Export from Pocket app, parsed as CSV           |
| Wallabag JSON    | `.json`           | Export format from Wallabag read-it-later service |
| Omnivore Zip     | `.zip`            | Archive format from Omnivore service with metadata JSON files |

### Export Output
- Export a full JSON backup including collections, links, tags, and pinned links
- Download automatically as `backup.json`

## 3. How to Export Your Bookmarks from Linkwarden

Follow these steps to create a backup of your bookmarks:

<Steps>
<Step title="Access Export Feature">
  From within the Linkwarden web app, locate the export option (typically in your profile or settings menu).
</Step>
<Step title="Initiate Export Request">
  Trigger the export. This will generate a JSON file containing your complete bookmarks data.
</Step>
<Step title="Download Backup File">
  Your browser will download a `backup.json` file automatically.
  Save this file securely—it will be used for import or backup purposes.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
Your exported file contains collections, each with their corresponding links and tags. This file can later be used to restore or migrate bookmarks.
</Check>

## 4. How to Import Bookmarks into Linkwarden

### Launching the Import Interface
- Use the `Import` button in the Linkwarden web interface.
- A dropdown menu will let you select your source format: Linkwarden Backup, HTML, Pocket CSV, Wallabag JSON, or Omnivore ZIP.

### Step-by-Step Import Process

<Steps>
<Step title="Choose Your Import Format">
  Select the source platform/file format from the import dropdown menu.
</Step>
<Step title="Select the File to Import">
  Upload the exported bookmark file from your previous tool or a compatible file.
</Step>
<Step title="Begin the Import">
  The system reads and processes the file. This may take several seconds depending on file size.
</Step>
<Step title="Monitoring Progress and Completion">
  Watch for notifications confirming success or warning if any problems were detected.
</Step>
</Steps>

### What Happens During Import
- Linkwarden parses the file based on the format.
- Creates new collections (named accordingly, e.g., "Imports" or based on the original collection names).
- Validates URLs to avoid importing invalid or corrupted links.
- Adds tags associated with each bookmark.
- Rejects duplicates silently.

### File Format Specifics

| Format           | Key Notes on Processing                                                            |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Linkwarden JSON  | Preserves collection structure, descriptions, colors, pinned tags                 |
| HTML Bookmark     | Parses bookmark folders and subfolders to recreate collection hierarchies           |
| Pocket CSV       | Creates new collection "Imports" with imported links and tags separated by "|"  |
| Wallabag JSON    | Imports starred/bookmarked status, contents as descriptions, tags, and collections  |
| Omnivore Zip     | Extracts metadata from multiple JSON files inside zip, aggregates into collections |

## 5. Advanced Migration Tips

### Migrating from Other Tools
- Before export/import, clean up bookmarks in the source tool.
- Export using the closest supported format.
- For Omnivore ZIP files, use the built-in processing to parse multiple metadata files.

### Handling Large Imports
- Be mindful of subscription or storage limits. The system checks if importing exceeds your link limits and rejects overly large imports with a clear error message.
- Consider breaking large exports into smaller chunks.

### Naming Imports
- Imported collections are named based on the original source or default to names like "Imports" or "Omnivore Imports." You can rename collections within Linkwarden after import.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Import Fails or Errors
- **File too large:** Check environment or subscription limits; try splitting the export.
- **Parsing error:** Confirm file format matches the selected import type.
- **Invalid URLs:** Links with malformed URLs are skipped. Review and clean your export if many fail.
- **Duplicate bookmarks:** Linkwarden avoids duplicates silently, but duplicates in the original file are ignored.

### Import Does Not Show Expected Bookmarks
- Refresh the page after import completion.
- Check the collections pane for newly created collections named after import source.
- Confirm file contents include bookmarks by opening outside Linkwarden.

### Export Missing Data
- Ensure you have the necessary user permissions.
- Verify network stability during export.

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Tips">
<Accordion title="Handling Large Files and Limits">
If your subscription restricts the number of links, imports will be blocked when exceeding the limit. Consider upgrading or importing fewer bookmarks at a time.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Corrupted or Unsupported Files">
Ensure the export file is intact and matches the expected format (e.g., JSON, HTML, CSV, ZIP). Open files in text editors or archive managers to verify.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Dealing with Invalid URLs">
Links missing valid URLs or with malformed syntax are skipped during import. Review your source export and clean invalid links.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 7. Practical Examples

### Importing Pocket CSV
- Export bookmarks from Pocket as CSV file
- Use Linkwarden's import dropdown and select "From Pocket"
- Select your exported `.csv` file
- Import automatically creates a collection named "Imports" and converts tags separated by the "|" character

### Importing from a Browser HTML Bookmark File
- Export bookmarks from your browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) as an HTML file
- In Linkwarden, select "From HTML"
- Upload the `.html` file
- Folder and subfolder structures are reconstructed as collections
- Bookmarks are added to corresponding collections

### Exporting Linkwarden Bookmarks
- Go to export in your profile
- Download the `backup.json` file for backup or migration

Always back up your import files before proceeding. If an import fails, restoring your previous state ensures no data loss.
</Tip>

<Note>
For developers or advanced users: Importing and export operations are handled via API endpoints `/api/v1/migration` exposed by Linkwarden, supporting POST for imports with various formats and GET for exporting user data.
